👋 Hi, I'm Marvin!

🚀 I am a software engineer passionate about creating innovative solutions and building impactful applications. I recently graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program, where I honed my skills in full-stack web development.

💼 I worked at Adobe in the position of SWE Adobe Video Cloud Intern, where I am contributing to the development of Adobe's video solutions.

🌱 I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies to expand my knowledge and enhance my coding abilities. My interests lie in web development, software architecture, and creating seamless user experiences.
